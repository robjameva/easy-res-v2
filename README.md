## Description

* Easy Res is an online restaurant reservation service similar to Open Table or Resy. Users can find their favortie restaurants on Easy Res, select their reservation time, and how many people are in their party. Easy Res will send a text conformation letting the user know their reservation has been confirmed. Upon landing on the Home Page, there will be a carousel of restaurants displayed on cards to give users some idea of what is available to them. On these carousel cards, users can click on three different icons to bring up a google maps gps guide to the restaurant, call the restaurant through the phone icon, or go directly to yelp reviews for that specific restaurant. Users also have the option to view all of their reservations in one place under the User Dashboard page. In addition, users also have the ability to sign up as a restaurant owner, and can sign up their restaurant to be hosted on the app. Once logged in as an owner, they can visit their Owner Dashboard to see a list of all of their owned restaurants, as well as an organized list of all reservations on that page as well. Another useful functionality is that users also have the ability to edit their profile settings, update their reservation information, as well as delete their reservation altogether if need be.
